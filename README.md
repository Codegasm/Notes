Intro
-----

Just a simple CRUD app in order to get Spine, Rails and jQTouch working
together with a JS templating engine. At this point I am using EJS.

Todo
----
* Start using jQTouch navigation instead of only spine.
* This includes the back navigation which is hard coded now.
* Add iScroll.
* Add polling that keeps the views fresh when changes occur on the server side.
* Look into how bundling the app into Phonegap would work.
